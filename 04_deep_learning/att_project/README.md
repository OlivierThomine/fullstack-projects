# AT&T – Deep Learning

## Project Description
AT&T wants to improve its user safety by implementing a spam detection system for SMS messages. The company has previously flagged spam manually but now seeks to automate this process using deep learning to ensure real-time protection and scalability.

## Objectives
- Build a model capable of classifying SMS messages as spam or not based solely on their content.
- Compare deep learning approaches and evaluate performance on text classification.
- Leverage transfer learning if necessary to improve model accuracy with limited data.

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- pandas  
- PyTorch
- scikit-learn
