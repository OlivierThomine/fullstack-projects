# Uber Pickups – Unsupervised Learning

## Project Description
Uber aims to improve its customer experience by reducing pickup delays, which often occur when there is a mismatch between user location and driver availability. This project focuses on identifying "hot zones" in New York City—areas and times where demand is highest—so drivers can be proactively positioned in advance.

## Objectives
- Detect spatial and temporal hotspots of ride requests in NYC.
- Compare clustering techniques (e.g., KMeans vs DBSCAN) to identify the most accurate method.
- Help Uber drivers optimize their location strategy to reduce user wait time.

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- plotly
