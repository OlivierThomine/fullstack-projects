# Getaround – Model Deployment

## Project Description
Getaround is a peer-to-peer car rental platform. Late returns between two bookings often generate friction between users. This project aims to analyze the impact of late checkouts and support product decisions through a web dashboard. Additionally, a machine learning model is deployed to assist with price optimization.

## Objectives
- Analyze the impact of rental overlaps and late checkouts.
- Help define a buffer time policy between rentals.
- Build and deploy a machine learning model to suggest optimal prices.
- Provide a functional API and documentation for external use.

## Tech Stack
- Python  
- pandas  
- scikit-learn  
- Streamlit  
- FastAPI  
- MLflow  
- AWS S3  
- Hugging Face Spaces
