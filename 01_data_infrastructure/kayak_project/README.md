# Kayak – Data Collection & Infrastructure

## Project Description
Kayak is a travel search engine that helps users plan their trips by comparing prices for flights, hotels, and car rentals. To enrich the user experience, the marketing team wants to launch a destination recommendation feature based on real data (weather, hotels, etc.).

This project aims to build a robust data infrastructure capable of collecting, storing, and preparing travel-related data, weather forecasts and hotel listings, for France’s top 35 destinations.

## Objectives
- Automate the collection of weather and hotel data for major tourist cities in France.
- Store the raw and processed data in a cloud-based data lake and warehouse.
- Provide clean, structured data that can later be used for recommendations.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- APIs
- Web Scraping
- AWS S3
- AWS RDS – PostgreSQL
- plotly
